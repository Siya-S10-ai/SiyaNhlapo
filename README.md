# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Siya](https://sensational-frangollo-2334c4.netlify.app), a software engineer student based in South Africa.

- ðŸŒµ I'm currently enrolled into a three courses [@CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/career-center). [Python3](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-python-3), [Java](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-java), and on a [Full-Stack Engineer](https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/full-stack-engineer)Career Path.
- ðŸ¤– I am fascinated by how technology can impact the world around us. Building projects that bring value to society and users is a long-standing passion that I carry with me wherever I go.
- ðŸ§­ Natural Language Processing is also a concept that fascinates me and when ever I get the time, I love diving deep to explore [tokenization](https://medium.com/@abdallahashraf90x/tokenization-in-nlp-all-you-need-to-know-45c00cfa2df7) through python.

I recently completed a certificate on [Intro to OPENAI API](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/intro-to-open-ai-gpt-api) [@CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/career-center). I was exploring OpenAI's API and learnt how to write more effective generative AI prompts that help improve search results.

My next mission is DevOps. ðŸš€
